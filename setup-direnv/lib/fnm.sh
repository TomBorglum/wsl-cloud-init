# CI-only (GitHub Actions) direnv directive for Node via fnm. The action installs
# this file onto the runner's ~/.config/direnv/lib; it is never run outside GitHub
# Actions. Self-contained by design: it sources no other file in this repository.
#
# Deliberately simpler than the terminal directive in
# wsl/user/.config/direnv/lib/fnm.sh: that version's arg checks and PATH_add exist to
# keep direnv's interactive load/unload clean, which CI does not do. Node has no
# canonical <TOOL>_HOME convention, so this exports only the bin dir to $GITHUB_PATH
# (no $GITHUB_ENV, unlike use_sdk).
