# CI-only (GitHub Actions) direnv directive for a pixi workspace. The action
# installs this file onto the runner's ~/.config/direnv/lib; it is never run
# outside GitHub Actions. Self-contained by design: it sources no other file in
# this repository.
#
# Deliberately simpler than the terminal directive in
# wsl/user/.config/direnv/lib/pixi.sh: that version's PATH_add exists to keep
# direnv's interactive load/unload clean, which CI does not do. It also does NOT
# scaffold a pixi.toml — CI activates a workspace the repo already commits, so a
# missing manifest is a hard error, not a convenience to paper over. pixi has no
# canonical <TOOL>_HOME convention, so this exports only bin dirs to $GITHUB_PATH
# (no $GITHUB_ENV, like use_fnm and unlike use_sdk).

  # of fnm's --install-dir. Value stays ~/.pixi to match action.yml's cache path.

  # transfer to HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ (no plaintext redirects); PIXI_NO_PATH_UPDATE=1 is
  # the pixi analog of fnm's --skip-shell — it stops the installer editing shell rc
  # files, a no-op in CI since we put pixi on PATH ourselves. Matches

  # returns non-zero on real failure, so gate on its exit code directly (rather
  # than `|| true` + a later check). This single gate is the success signal — like
  # fnm.sh's node resolution — and catches both a failed pixi install
  # (command-not-found) and a missing manifest, which pixi rejects more accurately
  # than a pixi.toml/pyproject.toml file test would. The terminal directive
