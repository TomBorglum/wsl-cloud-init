# CI-only (GitHub Actions) direnv directive for JVM SDKs via SDKMAN. The action
# installs this file onto the runner's ~/.config/direnv/lib; it is never run
# outside GitHub Actions. Self-contained by design: it sources no other file in
# this repository.
#
# Drives SDKMAN the way its own docs do - install, then select - and lets the action
# forward the result. The terminal directive cannot: it selects with a plain `export`
# so direnv can restore the previous value when the directory is left, which CI never
# does. Arg checks, an SDKMAN_DIR override and PATH_add serve that same interactive
# load/unload and are absent here for the same reason.

  # function it defines is the guard, and installing is only the precondition for
  # sourcing - a defined `sdk` already implies an installed SDKMAN - so both sit behind
  # the one test. --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 pins the transfer to HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ (no
